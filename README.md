# The "Berichtsheft" CLI

In Germany, an apprentice needs to write a "Berichtsheft" every week to ensure they also do the "correct" work (e.g. making coffee as main task in a apprenticeship for an IT specialist is not correct).

In general, it is a summary of the tasks the apprentice has done in a week.

## Installation

`berichtsheft-cli` can be downloaded via multiple ways.

The first (and preferred way) is via `go get`:
```
go get -u github.com/tomsdevsn/berichtsheft-cli
```

In case of the client does not have `go` installed, it can be also downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/tomsdevsn/berichtsheft-cli/releases).

## Shell Completion

`berichtsheft-cli` provides various completion sets for the most common shells like bash, zsh, fish or PowerShell.
